# Overnight build report — `dev-agentMoney`

Autonomous `/loop` run against the milestone plan in `docs/plans/`. Branch: `dev-agentMoney`
(both repos). Rules in force: park-don't-fake · no push · no publish · no mainnet · secrets
never logged/committed · adversarial review on the **code** milestones (M2/M3.2/M4/M6);
self-review on trivial doc/shell changes (noted per row).

> **Two diffs to give your own eyes regardless** (flagged as work lands): the `auths audit`
> verifier (M2) and the EIP-3009 payment code (M3.2).

## Iteration log

### Iteration 1 — setup + M1.4 (start)
- Confirmed both repos on `dev-agentMoney`; gateway binary present; `auths/.env` correctly
  gitignored (secret invisible). Only uncommitted items were my own untracked planning docs.
- **M1.4a (README de-stale):** the `## Status` block still said *"Scaffold. The product isn't
  built yet… `--check` currently exits non-zero… the gateway is a stub"* — stale: the gateway
  is built and `--check` is GREEN. Rewritten to reflect reality.
- **M1.4b (run.sh assertion):** the gateway's own non-zero exit on any verdict divergence is
  the **authoritative structured gate**; the shell `grep "verdict.*$verdict"` is a redundant
  secondary check whose only flaw was loose substring matching. Tightened to an exact
  word-boundary token match (no gateway change needed — a JSON-emission rewrite would be
  disproportionate for a redundant check). Documented that the Rust exit-code is the real gate.
- Review: doc + shell only → self-reviewed (full adversarial subagent reserved for the code
  milestones). Gate: `./run.sh --check` re-run.

### Iteration 2 — M1 live (real recording + replay round-trip)
- System Python had a stale `anthropic` (0.18.1) that crashed on newer `httpx` (`proxies=`
  TypeError) — **not a fake, an env mismatch**. Isolated a throwaway venv with current
  `anthropic` (0.109.2); the key loaded from `auths/.env` via `set -a; . auths/.env; set +a`
  (never echoed/committed).
- **Recorded a REAL `claude-opus-4-8` tool-loop** (`examples/live/record.py`): the model read
  the two files and posted a `create_comment` triage — 3 calls, all in-scope (`fs.read`,
  `github.comment`). It even self-declined to over-reach, citing read+comment-only delegation.
- Made `run.sh` honor a `TRANSCRIPT=…` override (1 line; default fixture unchanged). Verified:
  the recorded transcript **replays GREEN through the gateway** (live→record→replay round-trip
  proven), and the committed fixture still passes. Evidence: `examples/live/transcript.recorded.json`
  (secret-scanned clean).
- **¹ Note (honest):** this run had **no emergent over-reach**, so it only exercises the
  `allowed` verdict. The live *refusal* (`outside-agent-scope`) is covered by the committed
  fixture (`examples/replay/transcript.json`: read=allowed, write=refused) + the hermetic
  `--check`, not by a live recording. Re-running `record.py` would eventually capture an
  emergent `write_file` over-reach for a live-refusal transcript — left as optional (didn't
  burn repeated API runs chasing emergent behavior).
- Review: data + 1-line shell → self-reviewed (secret scan clean, both `--check` paths green,
  fixture intact). Did NOT overwrite the committed fixture.

### Iteration 3 — M2 the moat → deep recon → 🅿️ PARKED (needs your decision)

> ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-06-18 — decision made: A + B1.** Persist the proof+receipt+rail-response log
> (A) **and** anchor the settled cost in a signed *settlement commit* (B1, not the weaker
> rail-attested B2). Full design is in `milestone_2_moat.md` (epics 2.0–2.4). The finding below is
> kept as the record of *why*.

I went deepest here as asked, and the deep read of the real data model says the moat **cannot
be built honestly as specced yet** — it presupposes persisted data the gateway doesn't produce.
I will not fake an audit over data that doesn't exist. The findings (grounded; file refs in
`milestone_2_moat.md`):

1. **The settled cost is never signed.** The per-call signed git commit
   (`auths-mcp-gateway/src/chain.rs`) covers only `{tool, args}` + an `Auths-Scope` capability
   trailer. The actual rail-settled amount is *not* in the signed proof — so "recompute true
   spend from the signed chain alone" is **impossible** without also recording rail responses.
2. **Proof commits are throwaway.** Each call's commit is created in a *fresh per-call git
   repo*, signed, verified, then discarded. There is **no persistent proof chain** on disk for
   an offline tool to re-verify later. The receipt keeps only the commit **SHA** (`proof_ref`),
   not the commit **bytes** — so the proofs can't be re-run through
   `verify_commit_against_kel_scoped` after the fact.
3. **Receipts aren't persisted in the live path.** `proxy.rs` only `eprintln!`s receipts; the
   replay path only `println!`s them. There's no receipt log on disk to audit.
4. **`auths audit` is already taken** — it's the dev/commit-signing compliance report
   (`auths-cli/src/commands/audit.rs`), a different feature. The spend-audit needs a new name
   (e.g. `auths verify-spend`).
5. The operator's `SettledCounter` (`budget-ledger/<key>.json`) is durable but **not anchored**
   to the KEL — exactly the thing the audit must not trust, confirmed.

**What IS honestly verifiable today (no change):** authorization — *who was allowed to do what*
— is fully independently checkable from a proof's commit bytes + the issuer KEL via
`verify_commit_against_kel_scoped` (forged/revoked/expired/out-of-scope all caught). **What is
NOT yet verifiable offline:** the *spend* (cost isn't signed) and re-verification of a *past*
run (proofs/receipts aren't persisted).

**The decision for you (why this is parked, not faked):** the real moat needs a gateway-side
addition + one design call — both flagged, neither safe to decide unattended:
- **(A) Persist a proof+receipt log:** have the live gateway write each call's signed commit
  bytes + receipt + the raw rail response to an append-only log, so an offline `auths
  verify-spend` can re-verify every proof and re-extract every cost. (Gateway change.)
- **(B) Anchor the settled cost:** either include the rail's settlement reference/amount in the
  signed material, or accept that cost is rail-attested (re-derived from the recorded response)
  rather than agent-signed. This changes the moat's honest claim and touches signing — a
  **crypto-semantics decision** the rules say to flag, not make autonomously.

**Once you pick (A)+(B), the audit is ~1 focused build** (new `verify-spend` reusing the *same*
`verify_commit_against_kel_scoped` + `rail::extract`, typed `AuditVerdict`, + the lift/forge/drop
red-team) — I've fully scoped it. Parking now and moving to the cleanly-achievable milestones
(M3/M4/M6) so the night still delivers committed, reviewed code.

### Iteration 4 — M6 concurrency property test ✅ (committed 200753bb, in auths)
- Added `concurrent_calls_never_exceed_the_cross_rail_cap` to `auths-mcp-core/src/budget.rs`: 50
  OS threads race one reserve→settle each (the "rail" touched OUTSIDE the lock — the genuine
  concurrency window) against a $10 cap. Under any interleaving exactly 10 settle, 40 refuse,
  none stranded, the cross-rail total never exceeds the cap.
- Gate: **5/5 non-flaky** + full crate **33 passed** + clippy clean.
- **Adversarial review: SOUND** — the reviewer mutation-tested it (dropped `reserve`'s Σ(holds)
  term → the test FAILED 5/5, proving it catches the over-commit bug), confirmed real threads +
  a real reserve→settle window, and proved the outcome is interleaving-independent (not flaky).
  No findings.
- M6 remaining (not yet done): fail-closed edges on downstream/gateway errors (proxy.rs) and an
  explicit injection-safety scenario — though the *property* (model over-reaches → refused
  `outside-agent-scope`) is already demonstrated by the committed `examples/replay/transcript.json`
  fixture + `--check`. Marked M6 🟡 partial.

### Iteration 5 — M3.2 x402 live settle → 🅿️ PARKED (supervised) + ⚠️ a real security finding

Assessed before attempting, as planned. Two things make the live settle a supervised task, not
a clean autonomous one — and one of them is a bug you should see:

1. **⚠️ KEY-LEAK (must fix, must-review).** The current
   `examples/payments/adapters/x402-adapter/settle.mjs` live path does:
   `fetch(.../settle, { body: JSON.stringify({ requirements, walletKey: env.X402_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY }) })`
   — i.e. it **transmits the wallet private key to the facilitator**. That's the exact leak M3.2
   exists to remove. (Blast radius is low — it's a throwaway base-sepolia burner, and the live
   path isn't exercised by the hermetic gate — but it must not ship.) I did **not** rewrite it
   autonomously: it's must-review payment code and a correct replacement needs the items below.
2. **Facilitator API unconfirmed.** `GET https://x402.org/facilitator/supported` just redirects
   (no JSON schema returned), so the exact `/settle` request shape isn't pinned from here. The
   x402 spec says `/settle` takes `{ x402Version, paymentPayload, paymentRequirements }` where
   `paymentPayload` is the **signed EIP-3009 authorization** (NOT a walletKey).
3. **Non-standard flow.** This is a standalone direct settle (no resource-server 402), so the
   `paymentRequirements` + `paymentPayload` must be constructed by hand.

**The correct rewrite (scoped for the supervised session, ~1 focused build):** load the key from
`auths/.env`; with `viem`, `signTypedData` an EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization`
(domain: name "USDC", version "2", chainId 84532, verifyingContract = base-sepolia USDC;
message: {from, to, value, validAfter, validBefore, nonce}); assemble the x402 "exact"-scheme
EVM `paymentPayload` from that signature; POST `{ x402Version, paymentPayload, paymentRequirements }`
to `/settle`; the **key signs locally and NEVER leaves the process** — only the signature is sent.
First verify the signature recovers the burner address locally (no broadcast), THEN do one real
base-sepolia settle for the tx hash. Worth doing with you watching (real key + a live broadcast).
Parked; moving to M4 (a clean self-contained engine test).

### Iteration 6 — M4 delegation tree → ✅ already engine-covered (no redundant test added)

Recon'd the real delegation engine before writing anything. Every property M4 asks for is
**already comprehensively tested** in `auths` — adding more would be a redundant fake-green, so I
did not:
- **Single-level attenuation** (scope/TTL/depth ⊆ parent): `auths-sdk/.../agents/scope.rs` tests
  `capability_subset_valid` / `capability_subset_invalid` / `ttl_exceeding_parent_is_rejected` /
  `depth_limit_is_rejected`.
- **Treasury aggregate-cap** (Σ children ≤ parent → `AggregateCapExceeded`): `treasury.rs`
  `subdelegation_within_parent_holding_holds_and_overflow_is_refused` + 5 more, plus
  `tests/integration.rs`.
- **Subtree / kill-switch revocation** (`revoke_batch`): `tests/cases/kill_switch.rs` (batch revoke
  + idempotent re-revoke).
- **Transitive revocation** (a delegate of a revoked delegator is rejected): the verifier's
  `DeviceRevoked` / `SignedAfterRevocation` verdicts (`commit_kel.rs`, ordered by KEL position) +
  `tests/cases/agents.rs` (`rotate_revoked_agent_rejected`, `agents_revoke_marks_revoked`, …).

**The honest M4 gap is the gateway END-TO-END** (the `auths wrap` command spawning a *nested*
sub-agent gateway bounded ⊆ its parent, with subtree revocation flowing through) — that's
**gateway wiring in `proxy.rs`**, the same class of work as M3, not an engine test.

---

## 🔭 Meta-finding (the through-line of tonight)

Three milestones (M2, M4, and — by the spec — M3) converge on the same truth: **the `auths`
engine is mature and thoroughly tested** (verifier, delegation, treasury, budget, revocation).
The remaining auths-mcp milestones are **not engine gaps — they're one piece of gateway work**:
extend `auths-mcp-gateway/src/proxy.rs` (today a single-downstream proxy that doesn't persist) to
(i) front **multiple rails** under one budget (M3), (ii) wrap **nested sub-agents** (M4 e2e),
(iii) **persist a proof+receipt+rail-response log** so the offline audit can exist (M2), and
(iv) tighten **fail-closed** edges (rest of M6). One focused, reviewable gateway effort unblocks
M2/M3/M4-e2e/M6 together — best done with you in the loop (it's the security boundary). M5
(console) is net-new frontend; M8's flagship demos depend on (i)–(ii) landing first.

This is why the night's clean, self-contained wins (M1.4, M1, M6-concurrency) are committed and
the rest are parked with precise scopes rather than forced.

---

## 🛑 STOP — the loop ran out of *cleanly-autonomous* work (not out of milestones)

Per the rule "STOP on no-safe-work-left": after M1.4 / M1 / M6-concurrency, **everything left is
gateway-restructuring, a crypto/payment decision, or net-new frontend** — none safe to do
unattended without forcing or faking. I stopped rather than manufacture motion. Nothing was
pushed; all commits are on `dev-agentMoney` in both repos.

### What you have, by commit
| Commit | Repo | What |
|---|---|---|
| `5304f2c` | auths-mcp | M1.4 — de-staled README + exact-token run.sh assertion |
| `7a69ed0` | auths-mcp | M1 — live opus transcript recorded + replays through the gateway |
| `200753bb` | auths | M6 — cross-rail concurrency property test (adversarial-review SOUND, mutation-proven) |
| `0a0bb57`,`027d423`,`bb0f501`,`6905575`,`c579582`,`5304f2c` | auths-mcp | the plans + this running report |

### Needs your eyes (ranked)
1. **⚠️ M3.2 key-leak (security):** `settle.mjs` transmits `X402_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` to the
   facilitator. Low blast radius (throwaway base-sepolia burner, not in the gate) but must not
   ship. Fix = the EIP-3009 local-signing rewrite (scoped in Iteration 5).
2. **M2 decision:** the offline moat needs (A) a gateway proof+receipt+rail-response log and
   (B) a cost-anchoring call (crypto-semantics). Both flagged in Iteration 3.
3. The **one gateway effort** (the meta-finding above) that unblocks M2/M3/M4-e2e/M6 together.

### Recommended next session (supervised, in this order)
1. **Gateway persistence + multi-downstream** in `proxy.rs` — one effort that turns M3 (multi-rail),
   M4-e2e (nested sub-agents), and M2 (proof log) from "parked" to "buildable". This is the
   security boundary → do it with review.
2. **M3.2 EIP-3009 rewrite** + one real base-sepolia settle (kills the key-leak, gets the tx hash).
3. **M2 `verify-spend`** once (A)+(B) are decided — ~1 focused build, fully scoped in Iteration 3.
4. Then M8 flagship demos (now that the gateway features exist) and M5 console.

**To resume the autonomous loop later:** re-run `/loop` with the same prompt — it reads this report
and continues from here.

---

## ▶️ Resumed — supervised session (2026-06-18)

You woke the loop back up with decisions made (M2 = A + B1) and a directive to actually *fix* M3.2,
not park it. New work, same discipline (build → gate → adversarial review → commit):

### M3.2 — ✅ key-leak FIXED + real settle landed (commit `a3ec01c`, auths-mcp)
- **The fix:** `x402-adapter/settle.mjs` no longer POSTs `{ requirements, walletKey }`. New
  `signExactEvmPayment()` signs an EIP-3009 `TransferWithAuthorization` **locally** with viem
  (`privateKeyToAccount → signTypedData`; EIP-712 domain from `requirements.extra`), self-checks
  offline that the signature recovers the burner, and POSTs only the signed `exact`-scheme
  `PaymentPayload`. **The private key never leaves the process.**
- **Gate:** `node test.mjs` 11/11 — incl. a leak-regression test on BOTH a reconstructed body AND
  the **real** `fetch`-stubbed `liveTestnetSettle` path (re-adding `walletKey` makes it go red),
  plus key/payTo input guards; existing hermetic checks intact.
- **Adversarial review: SOUND** — key-leak verified closed by mutation; EIP-3009 payload matches the
  coinbase/x402 v1 exact-EVM spec; offline self-check is real (a tampered sig fails to recover). Two
  caveats it raised were fixed (test the real POST path; drop the misleading empty-`payTo` default).
- **Real settles landed** on base-sepolia via the live `x402.org/facilitator`, key never transmitted:
  - `0xa5b0f9266c4444369b4471067b54a0ec18f03f89315f4100618aefe8d21090e8`
  - `0xe4377915791cb3d46e136defa12e9c007f7e9106069584ebf2c89b16be6b1e52`
  - (the committed `settle()` path itself completes the second one — the first attempt's HTTP-200
    non-success was transient.)
- **One out-of-scope note from review** (pre-existing, not introduced): the adapter trusts the
  facilitator's reported settled value; it does not re-check the on-chain amount against
  `maxAmountRequired`. Separate hardening, flagged.

### M2 — decision recorded: **A + B1** (see `milestone_2_moat.md` epics 2.0–2.4). Building.

- **Epic 2.4 DONE (commit `87599c0b`, auths):** the audit data model — `AuditVerdict` (typed:
  Consistent / TamperedProof / CostMismatch / BudgetMismatch / DroppedCall / Revoked) +
  `SpendLogRecord` (the JSONL contract: signed `call_commit` + `receipt` + `rail_response` + the
  B1 `settlement_commit`) — in `auths-mcp-core/src/audit.rs`. 37 tests green, clippy clean. Pure
  data → self-reviewed. **Placement corrected** to `auths-mcp-core` (it wraps `Receipt`; the dep
  runs core→verifier, so it can't live in the verifier).
- **⚠️ Architectural finding (re-shapes 2.0/2.1, needs your awareness):** the **LIVE**
  `proxy.rs::call_tool` path does **not** sign a per-call proof or build a `Receipt` — it does a
  boolean scope check + budget and prints "receipted". Signed proofs exist only in the **hermetic
  gate** (`replay.rs`). So I'm building the audit over the hermetic gate first (2.0 persist →
  2.1 B1 settlement commit → 2.2 `verify-spend` → 2.3 red-team); **wiring signing into the LIVE
  wire so a live run is auditable is a separate MUST-REVIEW follow-on** (it changes the live
  wire's per-call crypto). Flagged, not done blind.
- **Epic 2.0 DONE (commit `fcd79bbd`, auths) — the spend-log WRITE PRIMITIVE.** The hermetic gate
  now appends a `SpendLogRecord` per call to `<repo>/spend-log/<delegation>.jsonl` (signed
  `call_commit` bytes + receipt + `rail_response`). Read side + path layout live in `auths-mcp-core`
  (`spend_log_path`/`read_spend_log`, shared with the `auths-cli` auditor); gateway owns the append.
  Gate: core 39 + gateway 10 + clippy + `./run.sh --check` GREEN. **Adversarial review: SOUND on the
  write path** (persisted bytes are the real judged proof incl. tamper; append-only structurally
  guaranteed; path-traversal-safe; fails closed; no secret in the hermetic fixture). Reviewer's fair
  finding: *2.0 is the write primitive, not yet a working audit* — the end-to-end
  write→read→re-verify-catches-tamper proof is folded into **2.2 (`verify-spend`) + 2.3 (red-team)**.
  Acted on the one forward-looking fix: a live-wiring **header caveat** on `rail_response`
  (capture body only, never an `Authorization` header — for when the live path populates it).
- **Epic 2.1 (B1) 🅿️ PARKED — needs your grant-model call.** `chain.sign_call` can sign arbitrary
  canonical bytes under any capability, and the verifier checks `capability ⊆ anchored scope`. So a
  settlement commit must claim a capability the agent HOLDS — which forces a choice:
  - **Option A (recommended):** add a narrow **`settle`** capability to the agent's grant; the agent
    attests its own spend under a dedicated bounded authority. Semantically honest; keeps the audit's
    canonical types clean (`type:"settlement"` distinct from a tool call). Cost: the grant model +
    verifier scope set gain `settle`.
  - **Option B:** sign the settlement under the **call's own** capability (already held) — no grant
    change, but conflates a settlement with a tool capability; the audit must distinguish by content.
  Both achieve B1's property (the agent cryptographically signs the cost; the operator can't forge it
  without the key) and are ~1 focused build once chosen. Parked because it's an
  authorization-semantics decision (must-review), not a blind autonomous call. **Pick A or B and I'll
  build it.** Meanwhile building 2.2 (`verify-spend`), which needs no decision and proves the moat's
  core (re-verify proofs offline → catch a tampered proof) — B1 then upgrades cost from
  rail-response-attested to agent-signed.
- **Epic 2.2 DONE (commit `eb85d7b3`, auths) — the auditor core `audit_spend_log`.** Re-verifies
  each spend-log record's signed `call_commit` through the **same** `verify_commit_against_kel_scoped`
  the gate uses (reusing the gate's `CommitVerdict→Verdict` mapping) → `TamperedProof`/`Revoked`; sums
  the rail-attested cost and cross-checks the operator's cumulative → typed `AuditVerdict`. **The
  adversarial review earned its keep:** it caught a real bug — the cost sum was gated on the
  operator-controlled `receipt.verdict` — now gated on the **re-derived** (proof-determined) verdict,
  so a settled call can't be relabeled refused without breaking its signature; `replay.rs` records
  `rail_response` only for forwarded calls; docs de-overclaimed (proof-authenticity is operator-proof,
  cost is rail-attested until B1). Gate: core 39 + gateway 10 + clippy + `--check` GREEN. **Next:
  2.3** wires the end-to-end proof (tampered replay → read the real log → `audit_spend_log` →
  `TamperedProof`), converting 2.0+2.2 from primitives into a demonstrated moat.
- **Epic 2.3 DONE (commit `026a037b` auths + run.sh) — 🎯 THE MOAT, PROVEN END-TO-END.**
  `PerCallGate::audit_spend_log` re-runs the offline audit with the gate's own resolved KELs;
  `replay.rs run()` self-audits the spend log it just wrote; **`./run.sh --check` now gates on three
  things**: the smoke, a **clean self-audit** (`audit: consistent`), and an **audit red-team** — a
  fresh-sandbox replay with `AUTHS_MCP_REPLAY_TAMPER` whose forged proof the offline audit
  independently catches (`audit: tampered-proof`). All GREEN. **Adversarial review: SOUND** — the
  red-team is a genuine catch (`tampered-proof` can only come from a real signature failure), it goes
  RED if the audit were broken (no vacuous pass), the tamper sandbox is isolated, and the KELs are the
  same the live gate used. **This is M2's headline claim — "a hostile operator can't hand you a
  doctored log that audits clean" — demonstrated, not asserted.**
  - **M2 status:** the moat (authorization re-verification) is now **demonstrated end-to-end** over the
    hermetic gate (2.0 write · 2.2 audit · 2.3 proof · 2.4 model). **Remaining, both flagged for you:**
    **2.1/B1** (agent-signed cost — your A/B grant-model call) and **live-wire signing** (so a LIVE,
    not just hermetic, run is auditable — a must-review `proxy.rs::call_tool` change). An offline
    `auths verify-spend` CLI (resolve KELs from an issuer KEL file) is the remaining packaging.
- **`verify-spend` CLI DONE (commit `38da8983` auths + run.sh) — the moat is now a STANDALONE
  TOOL.** `auths-mcp-gateway verify-spend --log --registry --agent --root` resolves the KELs from
  the issuer registry on disk (same `PerCallGate::resolve` the gate uses), runs `audit_spend_log`,
  exits non-zero on any non-`consistent` verdict — so a customer / CI / third party re-derives
  spend + catches a forged proof **from disk alone**. `./run.sh --check` now also runs the CLI as a
  separate process and asserts it agrees (`verify-spend: consistent`). Adversarial review **SOUND**
  (fail-closed exit codes, genuinely offline, no secret leak, genuine gate). **M2's user-facing
  surface is complete**; only B1 (your A/B call) + live-wire signing remain, both flagged.
